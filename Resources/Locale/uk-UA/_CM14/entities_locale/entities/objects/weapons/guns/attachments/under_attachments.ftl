ent-CMUnderAttachmentBase = { ent-CMAttachmentBase }
    .desc = { ent-CMAttachmentBase.desc }

ent-CMAttachmentAngledGrip = angled grip
    .desc = "An angled foregrip that improves weapon ergonomics resulting in faster wielding time.

ent-CMAttachmentBipod = bipod
    .desc = "A simple set of telescopic poles to keep a weapon stabilized during firing.

ent-CMAttachmentBurstFireAssembly = burst fire assembly
    .desc = "A small angled piece of fine machinery that increases the burst count on some weapons, and grants the ability to others.

ent-CMAttachmentGyroscopicStabilizer = gyroscopic stabilizer
    .desc = A set of weights and balances to stabilize the weapon when fired with one hand. Slightly decreases firing speed.

ent-CMAttachmentLaserSight = laser sight
    .desc = A laser sight that attaches to the underside of most weapons. Increases accuracy and decreases scatter, especially while one-handed.

ent-CMAttachmentMiniFlamethrower = mini flamethrower
